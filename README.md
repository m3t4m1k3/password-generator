## Learning Goals

Implement a basic JavaScript application based on a given list of specifications and design file.

## Core Requirements

- [ ] Array to hold all possible chars
- [ ] Button to generate 4 random password options
- [ ] Display password options

## Stretch Requirements

- [ ] Ability to set password length
- [ ] 1-click copy password to the clipboard

## Additional Personal Stretch Requirements

- [ ] Option to turn symbols and numbers on and off

These are requirements I added to challenge myself further.
These come from noticing improvements that could be made while completing the core and stretch project requirements.
